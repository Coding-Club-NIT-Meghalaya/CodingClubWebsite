## Instructions: 🙅🏼 🙅🏼‍♂️

### 1. 🔰 Setup Your computer
##### Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and after installing go to git bash or cmd window and setup your identity using
`git config --global user.name "Github wala username"`<br/>
 `git config --global user.email example@gmail.com`

 ##### Download and install [VS code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for getting good feel while writing codes

### 2. 🔰Star this Repository

###### You can star ⭐ this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.


### 3. 🔰Clone the Repository

###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window(Command prompt).

###### We’ll use the `git clone` command along with the URL of the repository.


`git clone https://github.com/Coding-Club-NIT-Meghalaya/CodingClubWebsite.git`

###### Now we have the copy of file in our computer (you can cross verify it by going to the location showing in Command Prompt)


### 4. 🔀Navigate to the repository folder and make changes

###### to navigate from command prompt we have simple command called as `cd folderName` Here we will do:

##### ` cd CodingClubWebsite`

#### Make Changes Locally
##### For Ex:
##### Open the folder in VS code manually or use `code .` in command prompt it will directly open the all the files in editor.

##### Add your changes
 
###### Once you have modified existing files or added new files to the project, you can add them to your local repository, which you can do in two stages- (First Staging and then Commiting) 

###### For Staging we will use `git add` command with dot(.) that means stage all changes

#####  `git add .`

###### Next, we’ll want to record the changes that we made to the repository with the `git commit` command.

###### The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is. 

###### If you have a very short message, you can record that with the -m flag and the message in quotes:


##### `git commit -m "Added any Feature"`

###### At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes github repository:

`git push origin main`



#### :zap::zap: Hurray you have contributed to the repository. Go and cross verify it in Github.

### 5. 🔁Update Local Repository

###### While working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you’ll need to sync the changes mage by others by pulling the changes by others.

###### For this we use:
###### `git pull` or `git pull origin main`
###### After writing this on command prompt all the files in Github repository will come to your computer. It is recommended to do this before pushing the code to repository.



## 👑 👑 Hurray!!! WE just got closer to COMPLETING Website. 😃
